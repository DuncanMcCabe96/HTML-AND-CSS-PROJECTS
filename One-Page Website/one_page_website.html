                        <h5>PUBG: Battlegrounds (previously known as PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds) is a 2017 battle royale video game published by Krafton, and developed by Krafton's PUBG Studios. The game, which was inspired by the Japanese film Battle Royale (2000), is based on previous mods created by Brendan "PlayerUnknown" Greene for other games, and expanded into a standalone game under Greene's creative direction. Played from either a third-person or first-person perspective, up to one hundred players parachute onto an island where they are tasked to scavenge for weapons and equipment to kill other players while avoiding getting killed themselves. The available safe area of the game's map decreases in size over time, directing surviving players into an ever-tightening space to force encounters.</h5>

                        <h5>Tetris is a puzzle video game created in 1985 by Alexey Pajitnov, a Soviet software engineer. In Tetris, players complete lines by moving tetrominoes, which descend onto the playing field. The completed lines disappear and grant the player points, and the player can proceed to fill the vacated spaces. Though the core gameplay has remained consistent, specific game mechanics between different Tetris variants have differed, with some changes becoming standard overtime. Versions have been released for personal computers (PC), consoles, and mobile platforms.</h5>
